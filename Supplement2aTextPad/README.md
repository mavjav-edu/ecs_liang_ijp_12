**Supplement II.A: Creating, Compiling, and Running\
Java Programs from TextPad**

**For Introduction to Java Programming\
By Y. Daniel Liang**

This supplement covers the following topics:

-   Introducing TextPad UI

-   Creating a Java Program

-   Compiling a Java Program

-   Running a Java Program

-   Creating and Running a Java Applet

1.  **Introduction**

*TextPad* is a shareware Java IDE. It provides editing, compiling, and
running Java programs from a single user interface. It is a simple tool
for novice users to develop Java programs. You can also download it from
`[www.textpad.com`](http://www.textpad.com). You need to
install JDK before installing TextPad. JDK 1.6 can be downloaded from
<http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp>.

Assume you have successfully installed JDK 1.6 and TextPad. Start
TextPad. The main user interface appears as shown in Figure 1.

*The TextPad main window is the command center for the IDE.*

The TextPad main window contains menus, toolbars, file pane, editor
pane, and reference pane.

1.  ***The Main Menu***

The main menu is similar to that of other Windows applications and
provides most of the commands you need to use TextPad, including those
for creating, editing, compiling, and running. The menu items are
enabled and disabled in response to the current context.

2.  ***The Toolbar***

The toolbar provides buttons for several frequently used commands on the
menu bar. The toolbars are enabled and disabled in response to the
current context. Clicking a toolbar is faster than using the menu bar.
For many commands, you also can use function keys or keyboard shortcuts.
For example, you can save a file in three ways:

-   Select File, Save from the menu bar.

-   Click the \"save\" toolbar button

-   Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S.

>TIP:  
You can display a label known as *ToolTip* for a toolbar button by
> pointing the mouse to the button without clicking.

1.  ***The File Pane***

The file pane displays all files currently opened in TextPad.

2.  ***The Editor Pane***

The file pane displays the content of the file selected in the file
pane.

3.  ***The Reference Pane***

The reference pane gives the user a quick reference on ANSI Characters,
Control Characters, DOS Characters, HTML Characters, and HTML tags.

2.  **Creating a Java Program**

Let us use Listing 1.1 and Listing 1.3 demonstrate creating a Java
program from TextPad.

Every time you start TextPad, a blank document named

Document1 appears as shown in Figure 1. You can type in the following
code in the editor pane as shown in Figure 2.

![](media/image3.jpeg){width="3.6131944444444444in"
height="2.3930555555555557in"}

*You can type the source code in*

Choose *File*, *Save as* to display the Save As dialog box as shown in
Figure 3. Type Welcome in the File name field and select Java in the
Save as type field. Choose a folder where you want the file to be saved
and click *Save* to save the file. You will see the file name
Welcome.java now appears in the file pane, as shown in Figure 4.

*You can save the source code into .java file.*

**Figure 4**

*You can save the source code into .java file.*

To create a new Java source code file for Listing 1.3, choose *File*,
*New*. Document2 appears in the file pane. Type the code for Listing 1.3
in the editor pane as shown in Figure 5. Choose *File*, *Save As* to
save the file as a .java file named WelcomeInMessageDialogBox, as shown
in Figure 5.

**Figure 5**

*A new file is created for WelcomeInMessageDialogBox.java.*

3.  **Compiling a Java Program**

To compile Welcome.java, select Welcome.java in the file pane, choose
*Tools*, *Compile Java*.

**Figure 6**

*You can compile Java programs from the TextPad.*

4.  **Running a Java Program**

To run Welcome.java, select Welcome.java in the file pane, choose
*Tools*, *Run Java Application*. A DOS command prompt is started to
display the output from the print statement, as shown in Figure 7.

**Figure 7**

*You can run Java programs from the TextPad.*

5.  **Creating and Running a Java Applet**

Let us use Listing 17.1 demonstrate creating and running Java applets.
You can create a MortgageApplet.java in the same way you create a Java
program. To create MortgageApplet.html, choose *File*, *New* to create a
file and save it as .htm file, as shown in Figure 8.

**Figure 8**

*You can create HTML files from the TextPad.*

Compile all the classes required for the applet. Run the applet by
choosing *Tools*, *Run Java Applet*.

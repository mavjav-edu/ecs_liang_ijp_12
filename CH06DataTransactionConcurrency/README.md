    1.  Introduction

In the preceding two chapters, you learned how to use SQL to create
database objects such as tables, views, indexes, clusters, database
links, and synonyms, and how to use SQL to retrieve and modify database
contents. This chapter introduces how to use SQL to manage transactions
and control concurrency.

2.  Database Transactions

A *transaction* is a sequence of statements that forms a logic unit of
work. All the statements in a transaction must either all succeed or all
fail. Consider transferring funds between two accounts, for example, the
debit from one

account and credit to the other account must be in one transaction to
ensure data consistency.

A transaction begins with the user's first SQL statement and ends when
it is committed or rolled back. Once a transaction ends, the new
transaction starts with the user's next SQL statement.

A transaction is committed when one of the following occurs:

-   A SQL `commit` statement is executed.

-   A DDL statement is executed.

-   A DCL statement is executed.

-   A user exits normally from SQL\*Plus using the exit command.

-   A user disconnects from Oracle.

A transaction is rolled back when one of the following occurs:

-   A SQL `rollback` statement is executed.

-   A user quits from SQL\*Plus using the quit command.

-   The system crashes.

When a transaction is committed, the results from the DML statements are
permanently written to the database. When a transaction is rolled back,
the database is restored to before the transaction started.  
> NOTE: In the discussion throughout this chapter, we assume the
> statement has been parsed correctly. If a statement has syntax errors,
> the statement cannot be executed.

> NOTE: A transaction is committed when a DDL or DCL statement is
> executed regardless whether the DDL or DCL statement is successful. In
> Oracle, all the statements prior to the DDL or DCL statement committed
> first, and the DDL or DCL statement is then executed and committed in
> a new single statement transaction.

> NOTE: The successful execution of a statement is different from the
> successful execution of a transaction. A statement is successful if it
> is executed without error. A transaction is successful if all its
> statements are executed and committed successfully.

> NOTE: The failure of a statement in a transaction does not cause the
> transaction to be rolled back. For example, suppose an insertion
> statement failed in a transaction because of the violation of the
> primary key constraint, the insertion statement is rolled back and the
> transaction continues. This is also known as the *statement-level
> rollback*.

You can use the `savepoint` statement to identify a point in
a transaction to which you can later roll back instead of rolling back
the entire transaction. You can set any number of save points in a
transaction using the following syntax:

`savepoint *savePointId*;`

To roll back to a save point, use the following syntax:

`rollback to savapoint *savePointId*;`

For example, the following transaction has two save points:

`savepoint before smith;`

[update Faculty set salary = 70000 where lastName =
\'Smith\';]{.underline}

`savepoint before rove;`

[update Faculty set salary = 75000 where lastName =
\'Rove\';]{.underline}

`select sum(salary) from Faculty;`

`rollback to savepoint before rove;`

[update Faculty set salary = 81000 where lastName =
\'Greene\';]{.underline}

`commit;`  
>NOTE: The changes made by the DML statements in a transaction are not
> available to other transactions until the transaction is committed.

> NOTE: Oracle has an environment variable `autocommit`. By
> default, it is set to off. You can set it to on using the following
> command:

`set autocommit on;`  
When `autocommit` is on, every SQL DML statement is
> automatically committed after it is executed.

***\*\*\*End of NOTE***  
> NOTE: There are several techniques used by DBMS to facilitate

1.  Concurrency Anomalies

A database is shared by many users. Users can request transactions on
the database simultaneously. When multiple transactions execute
simultaneously in the database in an uncontrolled manner, conflict may
arise. Consider four scenarios with two transactions executing
concurrently:

Scenario 1: Transaction T2 updates the salary of the faculty with the
last name Lee and then Transaction T1 reads the salary of the same
faculty before T2 is committed, as shown in Figure 6.1. It is possible
that T2 may be rolled back. So the data read in T1 is not reliable. This
scenario is known as the *dirty read* anomaly. i.e. a transaction reads
data that has been written by another transaction that has not been
committed yet.

![](media/image1.png){width="4.8069444444444445in"
height="1.7930555555555556in"}

*When transactions are executed concurrently, the dirty read anomaly may
occur.*

Scenario 2: Transaction T1 reads the salary of the faculty with the last
name Lee, and Transaction T2 updates the salary of the same faculty and
commits it. Transaction T1 reads the salary of the same faculty again,
as shown in Figure 6.2. The two reads don't return in the same value in
Transaction T1. The data T1 is viewing has been changed by T2. This
scenario is known as the *repeatable read* or *fuzzy read anomaly*. i.e.
a transaction rereads data it has previously read and finds that another
committed transaction has modified or deleted the data.

![](media/image2.png){width="4.6402777777777775in"
height="1.9930555555555556in"}

*When transactions are executed concurrently, the repeatable read
anomaly may occur.*

Scenario 3: Transaction T1 lists the CS faculty, transaction T2 inserts
a new CS faculty, and transaction T1 lists the CS faculty again using
the same query, as shown in Figure 6.3. The same query in T1 returns
different result. This scenario is known as the *phantom read anomaly*.
i.e. a transaction reÂ­executes a query returning a set of rows that
satisfies a search condition and finds that another committed
transaction has inserted additional rows that satisfy the condition.

Execution Sequence Transaction T1

start transaction  
insert a new CS faculty into Faculty (set salary = salary \* 1.04
> where lastName = \'Lee\';
>
> commit;
>
> select \* from Faculty where deptID = \'CS\';

**Figure 6.3**

*When transactions are executed concurrently, the phantom read anomaly
may occur.*

Scenario 4: Transaction T1 increases the salary of a faculty with last
name Lee by 2% and transaction T2 increases the salary of the same
faculty by 4%. The executions of the transactions are interleaved, as
shown in Figure 6.4.

![](media/image3.png){width="5.086805555555555in"
height="1.3597222222222223in"}

*When transactions are executed concurrently, the override update
anomaly may occur.*

When transaction `T1` is committed, DBMS writes a new value
into the salary of Faculty 1. When transaction `T2` is
committed, DBMS also writes a new value into the salary of Faculty 1,
which overrides the update from transaction `T1`. So, T1's
update of the salary of Faculty 1 is in fact lost. This scenario is
known as the *override update anomaly*. i.e. a transaction overrides the
update of another transaction.

4.  Preventing Concurrency Anomalies by Setting Transaction Isolation
    Levels

SQL defines the notion of serializability. A schedule of transactions is
serializable if it is equivalent to executing the transaction in some
serial order. A serializable schedule ensures database consistency.
Obviously, the result of the schedules in both scenarios is different
from executing the two transactions sequentially, in the order of either
T1 then T2 or T2 then T1.

While serializablity is generally desirable, running many applications
in this mode can seriously reduce concurrency and slow down the
performance. Complete serializability could mean that a transaction
cannot update the table that is being queried by another transaction. To
ease the restriction, SQL92 defines four levels of transaction isolation
with differing degrees of concurrency. You can set the transaction to an
appropriate isolation level to prevent the abnormal scenarios while
retaining some degree of concurrency.

The four transaction isolation levels defined in SQL are *read
uncommitted*, *read committed*, *repeatable read*, and *serializable*.

1.  *Read Uncommitted Isolation Level*

The read uncommitted isolation level allows a transaction to read the
data that has been updated by an uncommitted transaction. Thus, all the
four concurrency anomalies may occur under this level. Read uncommitted
is not supported in Oracle.

2.  *Read Committed Isolation Level*

The read committed isolation level allows a transaction to read the data
that has been updated by a committed transaction. Changes made by one
transaction are not seen by another concurrent transaction until the
transaction that made the changes commits. Read committed isolation
prevents the dirty read anomaly.

Read committed is the default Oracle transaction isolation level.

3.  *Repeatable Read Isolation Level*

The repeatable read isolation level prevents the repeatable read anomaly
by guaranteeing that a transaction reads the same data repeatedly.
Oracle does not support this level, but it provides the read-only
isolation level, which is more restrictive than the repeatable read
isolation level. A read-only isolation level transaction permits only
SQL select statements, and does not allow SQL insert/update/delete
statements, but a SQL. A repeatable read transaction would also permit
insert/update/delete statements. To specify a transaction to be
read-only, use the following SQL statement in Oracle:

`set transaction read only;`

This statement establishes the current transaction as a *read-only
transaction*. All subsequent queries in that transaction only see
changes committed before the transaction began, except that queries do
see changes made by the transaction itself.

As shown in Figure 6.5, the two salary values read from transaction T1
are the same because the transaction is set at read only, even though
transaction T2 changed the same data value and committed the change.

![](media/image4.png){width="4.6402777777777775in"
height="1.9930555555555556in"}

*The read-only transaction prevents the repeatable read anomaly.*

4.  *Serializable Isolation Level*

The serializable isolation level can prevent all the concurrency
anomalies for the transaction. You can use the following command to set
a transaction isolation level serializable:

`set transaction isolation level serializable;`

This statement establishes the current transaction as serializable. If a
serializable transaction contains a DML statement that attempts to
update any resource that may have been updated in a transaction
uncommitted at the start of the serializable transaction, then the DML
statement fails. If a DML statement *from another transaction* that
attempts to update any resource that may have been updated in a
serializable transaction, the DML statement in that transaction must
wait until the serializable transaction is committed.

As shown in Figure 6.6, the update statement in the serializable
transaction T1 updates the salary, which causes the update salary
statement in T2 to wait until T1 is committed. As shown in Figure 6.7,
the update statement in the serializable transaction T1 updates the
salary that has been updated in T2. This would cause T1 to be non-
serializable and thus the update statement would fail.

5.  *Choice of Isolation Level*

Now you know what read committed, read-only, and seriablizable
transaction isolation levels can do. Which isolation level to set is
based on your transaction requirements. Table 6.1 summarizes how these
levels can be used to prevent possible anomalous scenarios.

*Table 6.1*

*Preventing Transaction Isolation Levels*

**Dirty Read Fuzzy Read Phantom Read Override Update**

Read uncommitted Possible Possible Possible Possible

Read committed Not Possible Possible Possible Possible

Repeatable read Not Possible Not Possible Possible Possible

Read-only Not Possible Not Possible Possible Possible

Serializable Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible

For many applications, read committed is the most appropriate isolation
level. Read committed isolation can provide considerably more
concurrency with a somewhat increased risk of inconsistent results due
to phantoms and non-repeatable reads for some transactions.

Read-only transactions are useful for reports that run multiple queries
against one or more tables while other users update these same tables.

Serializable is most restrictive. It is suitable for environments where
there is a relatively low chance that two concurrent transactions will
modify the same rows and the long-running transactions are primarily
read-only. It is most suitable for environments with large databases and
short transactions that update only a few rows.

Serializable isolation mode provides somewhat more consistency by
protecting against phantoms and nonrepeatable reads and can be important
where a read/write transaction executes a query more than once.

5.  Locks

Databases use locks to prevent the problems arising from concurrency.
Locks are mechanisms that prevent destructive interaction between
transactions accessing the same data. Setting transaction isolation
levels lets Oracle automatically control concurrency. Oracle acquires
locks implicitly to achieve the specified isolation level. The locks are
placed at the row-level. By locking table data at the row-level,
contention for the same data is minimized to increase concurrency.

You can also explicitly acquire locks on the rows and tables to have
more control on the transactions. In general, there are two types of
locks: *exclusive locks* and *share locks*.

Only one exclusive lock can be placed on a resource (such as a row or a
table); however, many share locks can be placed on a single resource.
Both exclusive and share locks always allow queries on the locked
resource but prohibit other activity on the resource (such as updates
and deletes). Specifically, the following lock modes are supported:

-   **`row share (RS)`**: This mode permits concurrent  
access to the locked table, but prohibits users from locking the  
entire table for exclusive access.

-   **`share (S)`**: This mode permits concurrent queries  
but prohibits updates to the locked table.

-   **`row exclusive (RX)`**: This mode is the same as [row  
share]{.underline}, but also prohibits locking in the  
`share` mode. A row exclusive table lock is acquired  
automatically for a table modified by the insert/update/delete  
statement.

-   **`share row exclusive (SRX)`**: This mode permits  
others to look at the rows in the table, but prohibit others from  
locking the table in the `share` mode or updating  
rows.

-   **`exclusive (X)`**: This mode permits queries on the  
locked table, but prohibits any other activity on it.  
Table 6.2 shows the compatibility of these locks.

  ------------- ---------------- ---------- ----------- ----------- ------
                RS               S          RX          SRX         X

  RS            yes              yes        yes         yes         no

  S             yes              yes        no          yes         no

  RX            yes              no         yes         no          no

  SRX           yes              yes        no          no          no

  X             no               no         no          no          no
  ------------- ---------------- ---------- ----------- ----------- ------

*Table 6.2*

*Compatibility of the locks*

You can acquire the

using the following syntax:

`lock table *TableName* in *lockmode* mode \[nowait\];`

*TableName* may be a table name or a view name. If a view is locked, the
base tables for the view are also locked.

Specify `nowait` if you want Oracle to return control
immediately on the lock command. If the specified table is already
locked by another user, a message is returned to indicate the table is
already locked.

For example, you can lock the `Faculty` table in exclusive
mode using the following command:

`lock table Faculty in exclusive mode nowait;`

In this case, the table is locked exclusively. Other users can query the
table, but cannot obtain any locks or perform other activities on the
table.  
NOTE: A locked table or view remains locked until you either commit or
> roll it back, either entirely or a save point before you locked it.

4.  Locking Rows in the Select Statement

Often you first view the records and then update them. You would like
the selected rows to be locked so that other users cannot lock or update
the selected rows before you complete your entire transaction. To do so,
you can specify a `for update` clause in the select
statement using the following syntax:

`select column-list`

`from table-list`

`\[where condition\]`

`for update of column-list` \[nowait\]

This statement automatically acquires a share lock on the table and
shared row exclusive locks for selected rows. Other user can still view
the selected rows, but cannot update the rows. You can now update the
rows. The locks are released when your transaction is committed.

For example, to update the salary for faculty Lee, you may first select
it using

[select salary from Faculty where lastName = \'Lee\' for update of
salary;]{.underline}

This statement automatically acquires a share lock on the
`Faculty` table and shared row exclusive locks for the row
whose `lastName` is Lee in the `Faculty` table.
The other users cannot view the Faculty table, but cannot modify the
rows for faculty Lee.  
NOTE: The column-list in the `for update clause` does not
> mean that the locking is at the column level. The column names are
> just used for reference information. The locks are on the rows, not
> columns.
>
> NOTE: The `for update clause` must appear in the top-level
> select statement. It cannot be used in a subquery.

5.  Deadlocks

Deadlocks can occur when two or more transactions are waiting for data
locked by each other and none of the transactions can continue. Figure
6.8 illustrates a deadlock situation where transaction T1 is waiting for
the data (Student) locked by T2 and T2 is waiting for the data (Faculty)
locked by T1. Neither can continue.

Execution Sequence Transaction T1  
start transaction start transaction
>
> lock table Faculty in share mode;
>
> select \* from Faculty;

*lo*lock table Student in share mode;

select \* from Student;  
lock table Student in exclusive mode;

\^lock table Faculty in exclusive mode;

**Figure 6.8**

*Transactions T1 and T2 are deadlocked.*

Oracle automatically detects deadlock situations and resolves them by
rolling back one of the statements involved in the deadlock, thereby
releasing one set of conflicting row locks. A corresponding message also
is returned to the transaction that undergoes statement-level rollback.
The statement rolled back is the one belonging to the transaction that
detects the deadlock.

Deadlocks can be avoided if the tables are locked in certain order. For
example, in the case of Figure 6.5, if both transactions T1 and T2 lock
the tables in the order of Faculty and Student, no deadlock would occur.

NOTE: Deadlocks most often occur when transactions explicitly override
the default locking of Oracle. Deadlocks occur infrequently because
Oracle itself does not use locks for queries.

Chapter Summary

This chapter introduced to use SQL for transaction management and
concurrency control. You learned how to set the transaction level to let
Oracle automatically manage concurrency, how to use the [lock
table]{.underline} statement to acquire `row share`,
`share`, `row exclusive`, [share row
exclusive]{.underline}, and `exclusive locks` explicitly,
and how to use the `for update` clause to lock selected rows
for update.

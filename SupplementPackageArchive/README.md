**Supplement: Packaging and Deploying Java Projects\
For Introduction to Java Programming\
By Y. Daniel Liang**

1.  Introduction

Your project may consist of many classes and supporting files, such as
image files and audio files. To make your programs run on the end-user
side, you need to provide endÂ­users with all these files. For
convenience, Java supports an archive file that can be used to group all
the project files in a compressed file.

Archiving makes it possible for Java applications, applets, and their
requisite components (.class files, images, and sounds) to be
transported in a single file. This single file can be deployed on an
end-user's machine as an application. It also can be downloaded to a
browser in a single HTTP transaction, rather than opening a new
connection for each piece. This greatly simplifies application
deployment and improves the speed with which an applet can be loaded
onto a Web page and begin functioning.

You can use the JDK **jar** command to create an archive file from the
class directory. The following command creates an archive file named
TicTacToe.jar for the TicTacToe program.  
**c:\\book\>jar -cf TicTacToe.jar TicTacToe.class
> TicTacToe\$Cell.class TicTacToe\$0.class
> TicTacToe\$Cell\$MouseListener.class**

The **-c** option is for creating a new archive file, and the **-f**
option specifies the archive file's name. Note that the TicTacToe
program consists of the classes TicTacToe.class and inner classes
TicTacToe\$Cell.class, TicTacToe\$0.class, and
TicTacToe\$Cell\$MouseListener.class.

**NOTE**  
The Java archive file format (JAR) is based on the popular ZIP file
> format. You can view the contents of a .jar file using WinZip, a
> popular compression utility for Windows, as shown in Figure 1.

utility.*

2.  The Manifest File

As shown in Figure 1, a manifest file was created with the path name
**meta-inf\\**. The manifest is a special file that contains information
about the files packaged in a JAR file. For example, the manifest file
in Figure 17.17 contains the following information:

Manifest-Version: 1.0

Created-By: 1.6.0 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)

You can modify the information contained in the manifest file to enable
the JAR file to be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, you can
add information to specify a **main** class to run an application using
the .jar file.

3.  Running Archived Projects

You can package all the class files and dependent resource files in an
archive file for distribution to the end-user. If the project is a Java
application, the user should have a Java-running environment already
installed. If it is not installed, the user can download the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) from java.sun.com and install it.

**NOTE**  
The Java Runtime Environment is the minimum standard Java platform for
> running Java programs. It contains the Java interpreter, Java core
> classes, and supporting files. The JRE does not contain any
> development tools (such as Applet Viewer or javac) or classes that
> pertain only to a development environment. The JRE is a subset of JDK.

To run **TicTacToe** as an application, take the following steps:

1.  Update the manifest file to insert an entry for the main class. You  
need to create a text file containing the following two lines:  
Main-Class: TicTacToe Sealed: true
>
> The first line specifies the main class. The second line is necessary
> to ensure that the first line can be inserted into an existing
> manifest file in a jar. Assume that these two lines are contained in
> the file temp.mf.

2.  Execute the **jar** command to insert the main class line into the  
manifest file in TicTacToe.jar, as follows:

**jar -uvmf temp.mf TicTacToe.jar**  
The **-u** option is for updating an existing jar file, the **- v**
> option is for displaying command output, the **-m** option is for
> appending the contents in temp.mf to the manifest file in the archive,
> and the **-f** option specifies the archive file's name.

3.  Run the .jar file using the java command from the directory that  
contains TicTacToe.jar, as follows:

**java -jar TicTacToe.jar**

**NOTE**  
You can write an installation procedure that creates the necessary
> directories and subdirectories on the end-user's computer. The
> installation can also create an icon that the end-user can
> double-click to start the program. For information on creating Windows
> desktop icons, please see Supplement I.E, "Creating Shortcuts for Java
> Applications on Windows."

To run **TicTacToe** as an applet, modify the **\<applet\>** tag in the
HTML file to include an archive attribute. The archive attribute
specifies the archive file in which the applet is contained. For
example, the HTML file for running **TicTacToe** can be modified as
shown below:

**\<applet**

**code** = \"TicTacToe.class\"

  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  **archive**                  = \"TicTacToe.jar\"

  **width**                    = 400

  **height**                   = 300

  **hspace**                   = 0

  **vspace**                   = 0

  **align**                    = mddle
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------

**\</applet\>**

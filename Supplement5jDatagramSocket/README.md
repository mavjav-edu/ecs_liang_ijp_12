**28.10 (Optional) Datagram Socket**

Clients and servers that communicate via a stream socket have a
dedicated point-to-point channel between them. To communicate, they
establish a connection, transmit the data, and then close the
connection. The stream sockets use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
for data transmission. Since TCP can detect lost transmissions and
resubmit them, transmissions are lossless and reliable. All data sent
via a stream socket is received in the same order in which it was sent.

***\<Margin note: datagram\>***

In contrast, clients and servers that communicate via a datagram socket
do not have a dedicated point-to-point channel. Data is transmitted
using packets. Datagram sockets use UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which
cannot guarantee that the packets are not lost, or not received in
duplicate, or received in the order in which they were sent. A
*datagram* is an independent, self-contained message sent over the
network whose arrival, arrival time, and content are not guaranteed.

***\<Margin note: packet\>***

In an analogy, a stream socket communication between a client and a
server is like a telephone connection with a dedicated link. A datagram
communication is like sending a letter through the post office. Your
letter is contained in an envelope (*packet*). If the letter is too
large, it may be sent in several envelopes (packets). There is no
guarantee that your letter will arrive or that the envelopes will arrive
in the order they were sent. One difference is that the letter will not
arrive in duplicate, whereas a datagram packet may arrive in duplicate.

Most applications require reliable transmission between clients and
servers. In such cases, it is best to use stream socket network
communication. Some applications that you write to communicate over the
network will not require the reliable, point-to-point channel provided
by TCP. In such cases, datagram communication is more efficient.

1.  *The `DatagramPacket` and `DatagramSocket`
    Classes* The `java.net` package contains two classes to
    help you write Java programs that use datagrams to send and receive
    packets over the network: `DatagramPacket` and

`DatagramSocket`. An application can send and receive
`DatagramPacket`s through a `DatagramSocket`.

1.  *The `DatagramPacket` Class*

The `DatagramPacket` class represents a datagram packet.
Datagram packets are used to implement a connectionless packet delivery
service. Each message is routed from one machine to another based solely
on information contained within the packet.

To create a `DatagramPacket` for delivery from a client, use
the [DatagramPacket(byte\[\] buf, int length, InetAddress host, int
port)]{.underline} constructor. To create all other
`DatagramPacket`s, use the [DatagramPacket(byte\[\] buf, int
length)]{.underline} constructor, as shown in Figure 28.21. Once a
datagram packet is created, you can use the `getData` and
`setData` methods to obtain and set data in the packet.

***\<PD: UML Class Diagram\>***

  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------
  j ava.net.DatagramPacket 

  length: int              Specifies the length of the buffer with get and
                           set methods.

  address: InetAddress     Specifies the address of the machine where the
                           packet is sent or received with get and set
                           methods.

  port: int                Specifies the port of the machine where the
                           packet is sent or received with get and set
                           methods.

  +DatagramPacket(buf:     Constructs a datagram packet in a byte array
  byte\`\], length: int,   [buf` of the specified
  host: InetAddress, port: `length` with the
  int)                     `host` and the `port`
                           for which the packet is sent. This constructor
                           is often used to construct a packet for
                           delivery from a client.

  +DatagramPacket(buf:     Constructs a datagram packet in a byte array
  byte\`\], length: int)   [buf` of the specified
                           `length`.

  +getData(): byte\[\]     Returns the data from the packet.

  +setData(buf: byte\[\]): Sets the data in the packet.
  void                     
  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------

**Figure 28.21**

*The `DatagramPacket` class contains the data and
information about data.*

2.  *`DatagramSocket`*

The `DatagramSocket` class represents a socket for sending
and receiving datagram packets. A datagram socket is the sending or
receiving point for a packet delivery service. Each packet sent or
received on a datagram socket is individually addressed and routed.
Multiple packets sent from one machine to another may be routed
differently, and may arrive in any order.

***\<Margin note: construct datagram socket\>\
***To create a server `Datagramsocket`, use the constructor
`DatagramSocket(int port)`, which binds the socket with the
specified port on the local host machine.

To create a client `DatagramSocket`, use the constructor
`DatagramSocket()`, which binds the socket with any
available port on the local host machine.

***\<Margin note: send packet\>***

To send data, you need to create a packet, fill in the contents, specify
the Internet address and port number for the receiver, and invoke the
`send(packet)` method on a `DatagramSocket`.

***\<Margin note: receive packet\>***

To receive data, you have to create an empty packet and invoke the
receive\^packet) method on a `DatagramSocket`.

3.  *Datagram Programming*

Datagram programming is different from stream socket programming in the
sense that there is no concept of a `ServerSocket` for
datagrams. Both client and server use `DatagramSocket` to
send and receive packets, as shown in Figure 28.22.

***\*\*\*Same as Fig25.21 in intro6e p852***

**Figure 28.22**

*The programs send and receive packets via datagram sockets.*

Normally, you designate one application as the server and create a
`DatagramSocket` with the specified port using the
constructor `DatagramSocket(port)`. A client can create a
`DatagramSocket` without specifying a port number. The port
number will be dynamically chosen at runtime. When a client sends a
packet to the server, the client's IP address and port number are
contained in the packet. The server can retrieve it from the packet and
use it to send the packet back to the client.

To demonstrate, let us rewrite the client and server programs in
Listings 28.1 and 28.2 using datagrams rather than socket streams. The
client sends the radius to a server. The server receives this
information, uses it to find the area, and then sends the area to the
client.

Since datagrams are connectionless, a DatagramPacket can be sent to
multiple clients, and multiple clients can receive a packet from the
same server. As shown in this example, you can launch multiple clients.
Each client sends the radius to the server, and the server sends the
area back to the client.

The server creates a `Datagramsocket` on port
`8000` (line 30 in DatagramServer.java). No
`Datagramsocket` can be created again on the same port. The
client creates a `DatagramSocket` on an available port (line
55 in DatagramClient.java). The port number is dynamically assigned to
the socket. You can launch multiple clients simultaneously, and each
client's datagram socket will be different.

The client creates a `DatagramPacket` named
`sendPacket` for delivery to the server (lines 57-58 in
DatagramClient.java). The DatagramPacket contains the server address and
port number. The client creates another `DatagramPacket`
named `receivePacket` (line 59), which is used for receiving
packets from the server. This packet does not need to contain any
address or port number.

A user enters a radius in the text field in the client. When the user
presses the Enter key on the text field, the radius value in the text
field is put into the packet and sent to the server (lines 74-75 in
DatagramClient.java). The server receives the packet (line 48 in
DatagramServer.java), extracts the data from the byte array buf, and
computes the area (lines 54-55 in DatagramServer.java). The server then
builds a packet that contains the area value in the buffer, the client's
address, and the port number, and sends the packet to the client (lines
60-63). The client receives the packet (line 77 in DatagramClient.java)
and displays the result in the text area.

The data in the packet is stored in a byte array. To send a numerical
value, you need to convert it into a string and then store it in the
array as bytes, using the `getBytes()` method in the String
class (line 60 in DatagramServer.java and line 72 in
DatagramClient.java). To convert the array into a number, first convert
it into a string, and then convert it into a number using the static
parseDouble method in the Double class (line 53 in DatagramServer.java
and line 81 in DatagramClient.java).  
>NOTE: The port numbers for the stream socket and the datagram socket
> are not related. You can use the same port number for a stream socket
> and a datagram socket simultaneously.

**Supplement: Simple DOS Commands**

**By Y. Daniel Liang**

To work with files in Command Windows, you need to know some simple DOS
commands. Here are several frequently needed commands:

-   **dir** \-- Lists all files in the directory.

-   **mkdir dirName** \-- Creates a new directory named dirName.

-   **cd dirName** \-- Changes to the specified directory. For example,  
**cd c:\\** changes to the directory c:\\

-   **cd** .. \-- Changes to the parent directory.

-   **del filename** - Deletes a file. For example, **del Test.java**  
deletes the file named Test.java in the current directory.

-   **del \*.\*** - Deletes all files in the directory. \[Caution: files  
deleted from the command window cannot be recovered.\]

-   **rmdir dirName** - Deletes the specified directory dirName.

-   **type filename.java** - Displays the contents of the specified  
file.

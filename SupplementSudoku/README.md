**Supplement: Case Study: Sudoku**

**For Introduction to Java Programming**

**By Y. Daniel Liang**

This case study can be presented after Chapter 8, "Multidimensional
Arrays."

This book teaches you how to program using a wide variety of problems
with various levels of difficulty. We use simple, short, and stimulating
examples to introduce programming and problem-solving techniques and use
interesting and challenging examples to motivate students in
programming. This supplement presents an interesting problem of a sort
that appears in the newspaper every day. It is a numberÂ­placement puzzle,
commonly known as *Sudoku*.

1.  Problem Description

***\<Side Remark: fixed cells\>***

***\<Side Remark: free cells\>***

Sudoku is a 9\*9 grid divided into smaller 3x3 boxes (also called
regions or blocks), as shown in Figure 1(a). Some cells, called *fixed
cells*, are populated with numbers from `1` to 9. The
objective is to fill the empty cells, also called *free cells*, with
numbers 1 to 9 so that every row, every column, and every 3\*3 box
contains the numbers 1 to 9, as shown in Figure 1(b).

(a) Input (b) Output

**Figure 1**

(b) *is the solution to the Sudoku puzzle in (a).*

***\<Side Remark: representing a grid\>***

For convenience, we use value 0 to indicate a free cell, as shown in
Figure 2(a). The grid can be naturally represented using a
two-dimensional array, as shown in Figure 2(a).

\(a\) (b)

**Figure 2**  
*A grid can be represented using a two-dimensional array.*

2.  *Problem-Solving Strategy*

How do you solve this problem? An intuitive approach to solve this
problem is to employ the following three rules:

Rule 1: Fill in free cells from the first to the last.

Rule 2: Fill in a smallest number possible.

Rule 3: If no number can fill in a free cell, backtrack.

For example, you can fill 1 into `grid\[0\]\[2\]`,
`2` into `grid\[0\]\[3\]`, 4 into
`grid\[0\]\[5\]`, 8 into `grid\[0\]\[6\]`, and 9
into `grid\[0\]\[7\]`, as shown in Figure 3(a).  
\(a\) (b)

**Figure 3**

*The program attempts to fill in free cells.*

***\<Side Remark: backtrack\>***

Now look at `grid\[0\]\[8\]`. There is no possible value to
fill in this cell. You need to backtrack to the previous free cell at
`grid\[0\]\[7\]` and reset its value. Since
`grid\[0\]\[7\]` is\
already *9,* no new value is possible. So you have to backtrack to its
previous free cell at `grid\[0\]\[6\]` and change its value
to 9. Continue to move forward to set `grid\[0\]\[7\]` to 8,
as shown in Figure 3(b). Now there is still no possible value for
`grid\[0\]\[8\]`. Backtrack to `grid\[0\]\[7\]`,
no possible new value for this cell. Backtrack to
`grid\[0\]\[6\]`, no possible new value for this cell.

Backtrack to `grid\[0\]\[5\]` and change it to 6\_. Now
continue to move forward.

The search moves forward and backward continuously until one of the
following two cases arises:

-   All free cells are filled. A solution is found.

-   The search is backtracked to the first free cell with no new  
possible value. The puzzle has no solution.

> `ation.html` to see how the search progresses. As shown in
> Figure 4(a), number 1 is placed in the first row and last column. This
> number is invalid, so, the next value 2 is placed in Figure 4(b). This
> number is still invalid, so, the next value 3 is placed in Figure
> 4(c). The simulation displays all the search steps.

3.  *Program Design*

The program can be designed as follows in refined with methods in (b):

\(a\) (b)

The `readAPuzzle` method reads a Sudoku puzzle from the
console into `grid`. The `printGrid` method
displays the contents in `grid` to the console. The
`isValid` method checks whether the grid is valid. These
methods are easy to implement. We now turn our attention to the
`search` method.

4.  *Search Algorithm*

To better facilitate search on free cells, the program stores free cells
in a two-dimensional array, as shown 8.a. Each row in the array has two
columns, which indicate the subscripts of the free cell in the grid. For
example, {`freeCellList\[0\]\[0\]`,
`freeCellList\[0\]\[1\]`} (i.e., {0, 2}) is the subscript
for the first free cell `grid\[0\]\[2\]` in the grid and
{`freeCellList\[25\]\[0\]`,
`freeCellList\[25\]\[1\]`} (i.e., {4, 4}) is the subscript
for free cell `grid\[4\]\[4\]` in the grid, as shown in
Figure 5.

![](media/image4.png){width="5.893055555555556in"
height="2.140277777777778in"}

**Figure 5**  
*`freeCellList` is a two-dimensional array representation
> for the free cells.*

The search starts from the first free cell with `k = 0`,
where k is the index of the current free cell being considered in the
free cell list, as shown in Figure 6. It fills a smallest possible valid
value in the current free cell and then moves forward to consider the
next cell. If no valid value can be found for the current free cell, the
search backtracks to the preceding free cell. This process continues
until all free cells are filled with valid value (a solution found) or
search backtracks to the first free cell with no solution.

![](media/image5.png){width="6.2131944444444445in" height="1.8in"}

***Figure 6***

*The search attempts to fill appropriate values in free cells.*

The `search` algorithm can be described as follows:

Step 1: (Initialization) Obtain a `freeCellList` from a
grid, as shown in Figure 5. Let k denote the index in
`freeCellList` with k initially 0, as shown in Figure 6.

Repeatedly perform Steps 2-4 until search ends with a solution or no
solution

{  
Step 2: Let `grid\[i\]\[j\]` be the current free cell
> being considered, where `i = freeCellList\[k\]\[0\]` and
> j= `freeCellList\[k\]\[1\]`.

Step 3: If `grid\[i\]\[j\]` is 0, fill it with 1.

Step 4: Consider three cases:

***\<Side Remark line 89: solution found\>***  
Case 1: `grid\[i\]\[j\]` is valid. If k is the last index
> in `freeCellList`, *a solution is found*. Otherwise,
> search moves forward with `k = k + 1`.
>
> Case 2: `grid\[i\]\[j\]` is invalid and [grid\[i\]\[j\] \<
> 9]{.underline}. Set a new value for the free cell with [grid\[i\]\[j\]
> = grid\`i\]\[j\] + 1`.

***\<Side Remark line 89: no solution\>***  
Case 3: `grid\[i\]\[j\]` is invalid and
> `grid\[i\]\[j\]` is 9. If `k = 0`, *search
> ends with no solution*. Otherwise backtracks with [k = k -
> 1]{.underline}, reset `i = freeCellList\[k\]\[0\]` and [j
> = freeCellList\`k\]\[1\]`, and continue to backtrack if
> `grid\[i\]\[j\]` is 9. When [grid\[i\]\[j\] \<
> 9]{.underline}, set `grid\[i\]\[j\] = grid\[i\]\[j\]` + 1.

}

***\<End Output\>***

The program invokes the `readAPuzzle()` method (line 6) to
read a Sudoku puzzle and return a two-dimensional array representing a
Sudoku grid. There are three possible outputs from the program:

-   The input is invalid (line 9)

-   A solution is found (line 11).

-   No solution is found (line 15).

***\<Side Remark: getFreeCellList method\>***

The `getFreeCellList(int\[\]\[\] grid)` method returns a
twoÂ­dimensional array storing the free cell positions.
`freeCellList\[i\]\[j\]` indicates a free cell at row index
i and column index j. The method first counts the number of free cells
(lines 35-39), then creates the array for storing free cell positions
(lines 42-49).

***\<Side Remark: `search` method\>***

The `search(int\[\]\[\] grid)` method starts search from the
first free cell with `k = 0` (line 69), where k is the index
of the current free cell being considered in the free cell list, as
shown in Figure 5.

The value in a free cell starts with 1 (line 74). If the value is valid,
the next cell is considered (line 81). If the value is not valid, its
next possible value is considered (line 86). If the value is already 9,
the search is backtracked (lines 89-97). All the backtracked cells
become free again and their values are reset to 0 (line 93). If the
search backtracks to the free cell list at position k and the current
free cell value is not 9, increase the value by 1 (line 101) and the
search continues.

The `search` method returns `true` when the
search advances but no more free cells are left (line 78). A solution is
found.

The search returns `false` when the search is backtracked to
the first cell (line 91) and all possible values are exhausted for the
cell. No solution can be found.

***\<Side Remark: isValid method\>***

The `isValid(i, j, grid)` method checks whether the current
value at `grid\[i\]\[j\]` is valid. It checks whether
`grid\[i\]\[j\]` appears more than once at row i (lines
109-111), at column `j` (lines 114-116), and in the 3\*3 box
(lines 119-122).

How do you locate all the cells in the same box? For any
`grid\[i\]\[j\]`, the starting cell of the 3\*3 box that
contains it is `grid\[(i / 3) \* 3\]\[(j / 3) \* 3\]`, as
illustrated in Figure 6.

![](media/image6.png){width="5.966666666666667in"
height="1.5798611111111112in"}

***Figure 6***

*The location of the first cell in a 3\*3 box determines the locations
of other cells in the box.*

With this observation, you can easily identify all the cells in the box.
Suppose `grid\[r\]\[c\]` is the starting cell of a 3\*3 box,
the cells in the box can be traversed in a nested loop as follows:

[// Get all cells in a 3 by 3 box starting at grid\[r\]\[c\] **for**
(**int** row = r; row \< r + 3; row++)]{.underline} **for** (**int** col
= c; col \< c + 3; col++) // grid\[row\]\[col\] is in the box

***\<Side Remark: find one solution\>***

Note that there may be multiple solutions for an input. But the program
will find one such solution. You may modify the program to find all
solutions in Programming Exercise 7.27.

***\<Side Remark: input file\>***

It is cumbersome to enter 81 numbers from the console. When you test the
program, you may store the input in a file, say sudoku.txt, and run the
program using the following command:

**java Sudoku \< sudoku.txt**

This program is not user friendly. You can improve it by providing a GUI
interface. See Exercise 18.25.
